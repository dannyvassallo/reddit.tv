#Reddit Tv Clone
Original Copyright (c) 2011 Raymond May Jr.

This is a clone with a simple deploy method for heroku. I plan on migrating the platform to meteor JS but until then wanted a version I (or we) could use! :)

####Local Use

Simply open the `index.html` file.

####Deploy on Heroku

```
git clone https://github.com/dannyvassallo/reddit.tv
cd reddit.tv
heroku create <<app name>>
git push heroku master
```
